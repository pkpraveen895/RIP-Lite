# RIP-Lite
Implemented an "application" layer routing protocol which implements distance vector routing using Bellman-Ford algorithm. TCP connection is created with the next hop neighbors and implemented Bellman-Ford algorithm on top of these TCP connections and exchanged routing information with the neighbors periodically.
